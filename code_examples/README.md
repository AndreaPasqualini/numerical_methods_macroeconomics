# Examples

Here there are some scripts that use methods from the [`NMmacro`](../NMmacro/) package.

The file `vfi_convergence.m` is a Matlab script that shows how VFI happens in the deterministic case of the Neoclassical Growth Model.
It creates a figure that is updated at every click (or button) press.
Every update corresponds to a new proposal for the value function.
It finally shows the approximate solution of the problem.
