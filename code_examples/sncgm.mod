%% sncgm.mod
% This Dynare file shows how first and second order approximations to the
% Stochastic NeoClassical Growth Model already do a good job at approximating
% the policy functions of the problem.
%
% To run this file, you need a working installation of Matlab and the
% associated plugin package Dynare (https://www.dynare.org/).
% With the requirements in place, you need to run
%     dynare sncgm.mod
% which yields some variables in the workspace. The policy functions are stored
% in the object 'dr'.
