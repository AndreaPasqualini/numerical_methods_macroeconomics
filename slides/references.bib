  abstract = {Why has the average real risk-free interest rate been less than one percent? The question is motivated by the failure of a class of calibrated representative-agent economies to explain the average return to equity and risk-free debt. I construct an economy where agents experience uninsurable idiosyncratic endowment shocks and smooth consumption by holding a risk-free asset. I calibrate the economy and characterize equilibria computationally. With a borrowing constraint of one year's income, the resulting risk-free rate is more than one percent below the rate in the comparable representative-agent economy. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

  abstract  = {This chapter examines local and global approximation methods that have been used or have potential future value in economic and econometric analysis. The chapter presents the related projection method for solving operator equations and illustrates its application to dynamic economic analysis, dynamic games, and asset market equilibrium with asymmetric information. In the chapter, it is shown that a general class of techniques from the numerical partial differential equations literature can be usefully applied and adapted to solve nonlinear economic problems. Despite the specificity of the applications discussed in the chapter the general description makes clear the general usefulness of perturbation and projection methods for economic problems, both theoretical modeling and empirical analysis. The application of perturbation and projection methods and the underlying approximation ideas have substantially improved the efficiency of economic computations. In addition, exploitation of these ideas will surely lead to progress.},

  abstract = {The Rouwenhorst method of approximating stationary AR(1) processes has been overlooked by much of the literature despite having many desirable properties unmatched by other methods. In particular, we prove that it can match the conditional and unconditional mean and variance, and the first-order autocorrelation of any stationary AR(1) process. These properties make the Rouwenhorst method more reliable than others in approximating highly persistent processes and generating accurate model solutions. To illustrate this, we compare the performances of the Rouwenhorst method and four others in solving the stochastic growth model and an income fluctuation problem. We find that (i) the choice of approximation method can have a large impact on the computed model solutions, and (ii) the Rouwenhorst method is more robust than others with respect to variation in the persistence of the process, the number of points used in the discrete approximation and the procedure used to generate model statistics. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

@article{Ma2009,
  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in analyzing and quantifying the effects of random inputs in the solution of ordinary/partial differential equations. To this end, the spectral stochastic finite element method (SSFEM) is the most popular method due to its fast convergence rate. Recently, the stochastic sparse grid collocation method has emerged as an attractive alternative to SSFEM. It approximates the solution in the stochastic space using Lagrange polynomial interpolation. The collocation method requires only repetitive calls to an existing deterministic solver, similar to the Monte Carlo method. However, both the SSFEM and current sparse grid collocation methods utilize global polynomials in the stochastic space. Thus when there are steep gradients or finite discontinuities in the stochastic space, these methods converge very slowly or even fail to converge. In this paper, we develop an adaptive sparse grid collocation strategy using piecewise multi-linear hierarchical basis functions. Hierarchical surplus is used as an error indicator to automatically detect the discontinuity region in the stochastic space and adaptively refine the collocation points in this region. Numerical examples, especially for problems related to long-term integration and stochastic discontinuity, are presented. Comparisons with Monte Carlo and multi-element based random domain decomposition methods are also given to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The grid construction is the key novel piece of our analysis: we select an $\epsilon$-distinguishable subset of simulated points that covers the support of the ergodic measure roughly uniformly. The proposed algorithm is tractable in problems with high dimensionality (hundreds of state variables) on a desktop computer. As an illustration, we solve one- and multicountry neoclassical growth models and a large-scale new Keynesian model with a zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.},
