# Other Python Applications in Economics

This folder contains Python code that is not related to numerical methods in Macroeconomics.
Instead, I provide examples of what Python can be useful for, and economists might find this interesting.


## Web-scraping with BeautifulSoup

The folder [`scraping`](./scraping/) contains an example of how to use the package [`beautifulsoup4`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to programmatically retrieve certain content from the web.
The code highlights the importance of analyzing the HTML structure of a webpage in order to understand where a certain piece of information can be found.

Note that Beautiful Soup only parses with HTML code that is returned from a web server upon load.
For webpages that dynamically change (because of Javascript, e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Reddit), Beautiful Soup might be useless.
In such cases, [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) comes in to help.


## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Example for the package [`nltk`](http://www.nltk.org/)

`incomplete`
