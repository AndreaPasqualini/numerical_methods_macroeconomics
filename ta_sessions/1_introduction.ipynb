    "For nonlinear models that feature smooth functions, we can get fast and efficient solutions by approximating the system of equations around some specific point.\n",
    "We can write any rational-expectations model in the following way:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f \\left( X_{t-1}, X_{t}, X_{t+1} \\right) = 0,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where I assumed that the model is deterministic.\n",
    "Stochastic models with rational expectations are similarly written (notably with an expectation operator), and are similarly treated.\n",
    "The solution to such a system of equations (assuming it exists and it is unique) is written as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_{t+1} = g \\left( X_{t}, X_{t-1} \\right),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $g(\\cdot)$ is a set of policy functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we can do with such a system is to take a Taylor expansion of $f(\\cdot)$ around a point.\n",
    "It is common to consider the first-order approximation (denote it with $\\hat{f}$) around the deterministic steady state of the model.\n",
    "Instead of solving $f=0$, we can solve $\\hat{f}=0$.\n",
    "As this new system is linear, we know we can easily solve it: the solution will be a linear policy function $\\hat{g}$ that will hold only in an arbitrary (small) neighborhood of the steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we know how to analytically solve the textbook version of the RBC model with full capital depreciation (i.e., $\\delta=1$).\n",

    "If we introduce discontinuities or non-differentiable equations in the model (e.g., borrowing constraints or discrete control variables), we cannot reliably take the Taylor expansion of a model.\n",

    "Projection methods try to force their way through a solution, mostly through a trial-and-error procedure.\n",
    "The intuition is very similar to the [Newton algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) to find roots of a function: you start with a proposal for the solution and you check if it works.\n",
    "If it does not, then you use some (educated) criterion to create a new proposal.\n",
    "You repeat the procedure until you arrive to the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty in the case of Macroeconomics is that the proposals we are dealing with are not points in a space of scalars, but are points in a space of functions.\n",
    "This might not be clear at first, as we are going to work with numerical representations of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clearest application of the projection method is probably the Aiyagari (1994) model.\n",
    "In such model, we should find a capital-remuneration rate $r_t$ such that all markets (goods, labor, capital) are in equilibrium.\n",
    "We will see the details in a dedicated TA session, but here is the gist of it.\n",
    "We enter the $n$-th iteration with a proposal $r_{t}^{(n)}$.\n",
    "We check if it clears the capital market: \n",
    "- if it does not because there is excess demand, we know we should have $r_{t}^{(n+1)} > r_{t}^{(n)}$.\n",
    "- if it does not because there is excess supply, we know we should have $r_{t}^{(n+1)} < r_{t}^{(n)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common critique to projection methods is the following: it is often the case that we cannot verify the solution we reach is unique (e.g., sunspots).\n",
    "So it might happen that you have models where the procedure never converges anywhere, or where the procedure converges to \"weird\" solutions.\n",
    "A way to deal with this is to carry out extensive (and sometimes painful) sensitivity analysis."
