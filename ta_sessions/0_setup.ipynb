    "Python alone cannot do much.\n",
    "It's a bit like installing a new OS on a computer: can you do stuff with it?\n",

    "With Python, we need [modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "As [it is not easy to manage modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell) manually, we're going to need a [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager).\n",
    "The one we choose for this setup is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), which is popular among people who need to do numerical and stastical work (some prefer calling it data science).\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and download the file that is relevant for your OS.\n",
    "You should choose the Python 3.x version, as the 2.x is [legacy (read: old) software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system) that is there for compatibility (i.e., targeting audiences different from us).\n",
    "You can find instructions on how to install Anaconda for [Windows](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/), [macOS](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/) and [Linux](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/).\n",

    "As the typical Anaconda installation includes all the packages we'll need, **we're done**.\n",
    "To confirm this is the case, search for [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) among your applications and launch it: this will be our [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for the rest of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one day you want to get rid of Anaconda, you can just follow the [instructions to uninstall](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/) it."
