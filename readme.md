# Numerical Methods for Macroeconomics

This repo is still in (super) early stages of its development.
Sooner or later I will add few Python packages that contain useful code for Macroeconomic applications.
First commits will be just general statistics- and economic-related functions, so no big deal.

With time however, this should be a full-fledged library (with examples) especially aimed at learning Python for (Macro)Economic applications.

This repository is aimed at PhD students of Macroeconomics 3 at Bocconi University.
