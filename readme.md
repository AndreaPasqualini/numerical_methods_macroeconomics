# Numerical Methods for Macroeconomics

This repo is still in (super) early stages of its development.

I am expanding this repo and adding new things as the course goes on.
For now, it is just a set of reference material: think of this as a basis for the coming work.

Given enough time, this should be a full-fledged library (with examples) especially aimed at learning Python for (Macro)Economic applications.

This repository should suit the needs of the PhD students of Macroeconomics 3 at Bocconi University.
Anybody else is free to get material from this repo and use it to fit their needs, as long as the License is noted (that is, give credit where due and you're good to go).


## Update

This repo is undergoing major maintenance.
The _desiderata_ is

- a set of Jupyter notebooks for the TA sessions I teach at Bocconi University
- a set of examples ready to be run on your local machine
- a set of exercises (with disclosed solutions??)


## Where else to look for material?

Here is a list of references and related material you might want to check out.
There is no specific reason these are here for, except for my own gut-feeling that suggested me to put them here.
