# Numerical Methods for Macroeconomics

This repository contains material for the PhD course in Macroeconomics 3, taught by Marco Maffezzoli at Bocconi University.
I'm the TA for the Spring 2018 and Spring 2019 iterations.

However, this repo will not be limited in scope to the course.
Given enough time, this should be a full-fledged library (with examples) especially aimed at learning Python for (Macro)Economic applications.
I'll update this repo with teaching (or self-learning) material as I progress in life.


## Overview of material in this repo

## Where else to look for material?

Here is a list of references and related material you might want to check out.
There is no specific reason these are here for, except for my own gut-feeling that suggested me to put them here.
